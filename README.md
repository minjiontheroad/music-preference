# Music Preference Analysis

In this notebook, I explore the Chinook database to analyze music listeners' preferences. Multiple tables are merged to link customer information with purchased tracks, and the results are visualized to uncover listening patterns. Finally, an artist recommendation system is developed using the Apriori association rule learning algorithm.
